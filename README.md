IOT-Air & Water quality checking & alerts
Real-Time Environmental Monitoring: A Smart Approach to Air and Water Safety

Introduction: This project involves creating a comprehensive system by using IoT sensors to monitor the quality in air and water. Which aims to detect the real time pollution levels and send alerts.
Significance: the continuous monitoring of air and water which can protect public health by preventing them to contaminants and also help towards creating smart, sustainable cities.

Approach

    IoT Sensors: Collect air and water quality data.
    AWS IoT Core: Secure data transmission.
    AWS Lambda: Processes data and triggers alerts.
    Amazon DynamoDB: Stores data.
    Amazon SNS: Sends real-time alerts.
    Amazon QuickSight: Visualizes data.
    Microcontrollers: Interface with sensors.
    Cloud Services: AWS for processing, storage, and alerts.

Expected outcome:

-Real time monitoring -Early detection of pollution -Enhanced public health and safety by providing timely alerts -Scalability and flexibility -Contributing to sustainable development by ensuring that environmental monitoring is continuous and efficient
